# Synto Labs Sales Playbook

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 9, 2026
**Philosophy:** Hormozi-inspired value-first sales

---

## The Synto Sales Philosophy

**Give value before you ask for anything.**

Traditional sales: Pitch → objection → close
Our sales: Value → trust → partnership

We don't sell. We solve problems. The sale happens naturally when the prospect sees we understand their pain and can fix it.

## 2. Cold Outreach Framework

### Email Sequence (4 emails over 14 days)

#### Email 1: Value-First (Day 0)
**Subject Line:** Built this for [Company] — took 3 mins

```
Hey [Name],

I was researching [Company] and noticed [specific observation:
e.g., "your team is manually qualifying leads from your contact form"
or "your sales team is spending hours on research before outreach"].

Ran your site through our automation engine and found:
• [Insight 1: e.g., "15+ hours/week on manual lead qualification"]
• [Insight 2: e.g., "No systematic follow-up workflow"]

I built a quick demo showing how we'd automate this.

No pitch, no calendar link, no obligation. Just wanted you to see
what's possible.

If it's useful, reply and I'll explain how we built it.

If not, no worries — keep the demo.

— Rhigden
Founder, Synto Labs
P.S. This research took 3 minutes. That's the power of multi-agent workflows.
```

**Key Elements:**
- Personalized observation (shows you did homework)
- Specific insights (not generic fluff)
- No pitch (value-first)
- Low-friction CTA ("reply if interested")
- PS adds personality

---

#### Email 2: Case Study (Day 3)
**Subject Line:** How [Similar Company] saved 20h/week

```
Hey [Name],

Since we last spoke, thought you'd find this relevant:

[Similar Company in your space] had the same challenge:
[specific pain point].

We built a custom workflow for them that [specific solution]:
• Scout Agent: Finds leads matching ICP
• Research Agent: Qualifies each lead in 30 seconds
• Writer Agent: Personalizes outreach
• Sender Agent: Sends at scale

Result: 20 hours/week saved, 3x response rate, $5k/month in
reclaimed capacity.

Full breakdown: [link to case study with screenshots and ROI numbers]

Want to see how this would apply to [Company]? Happy to do a
free audit of your current workflow.

— Rhigden
```

**Key Elements:**
- Social proof (similar company)
- Specific results (20 hours, 3x, $5k)
- Agent ecosystem mention (differentiation)
- Soft offer (free audit)

---

#### Email 3: Soft Offer (Day 7)
**Subject Line:** Free automation audit for [Company]

```
Hey [Name],

I've been thinking about your [specific challenge discussed:
e.g., "manual lead qualification process"].

Quick question: What's the ONE thing you'd automate if you could?

I'd be happy to do a free audit of your current workflows and identify:
• Top 3 automation opportunities
• Estimated time savings for each
• ROI projections (real numbers, not fluff)

No obligation — you get the audit whether we work together or not.

Worth 30 minutes of your time?

Reply "yes" and I'll send a Cal.com link.

— Rhigden
```

**Key Elements:**
- Refer back to previous conversation
- Question to engage (shows you care about their answer)
- Clear value (top 3 opportunities, ROI numbers)
- Low friction (just reply "yes")

---

#### Email 4: Break-Up (Day 14)
**Subject Line:** Permission to close your file?

```
Hey [Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming automation isn't a priority
right now.

That's completely fair — timing has to be right.

I'll close your file so I don't keep bothering you with emails.

If things change and you want to explore this, just reply and I'll
reopen it. No hard feelings.

Best of luck with [Company]!

— Rhigden
```

**Key Elements:**
- Respects their time (not pushy)
- Clear closure (no ambiguity)
- Door open for future (not burning bridges)

---

### LinkedIn Outreach

**Connection Request:**
```
Hey [Name] — saw your post about [topic]. Really resonated with
[specific point]. Would love to connect and follow your journey
building [Company].
```

**Follow-up Message (after acceptance):**
```
Thanks for connecting, [Name]!

Loving what you're building at [Company] — especially [specific thing].

Quick question: What's the most repetitive task your team does that
you wish would just... disappear?

Curious because we build custom AI workflows that eliminate exactly
that kind of busywork.

No pitch — just curious what keeps you up at night.

— Rhigden
```

---

## 3. Discovery Call Framework

### Pre-Call Checklist

- [ ] Reviewed their website and LinkedIn
- [ ] Identified 1-2 potential pain points
- [ ] Prepared relevant case study

- [ ] Prepared agenda (mentally)

---

### Call Structure (30 minutes)

#### Opening (2 minutes)
**Goal:** Build rapport, establish context

```
"Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. I know you're busy, so I want to
respect your time and make sure we get value out of this call.

I've spent some time researching [Company] and have a few ideas, but
I want to hear from you first.

Sound good?"
```

---

#### Discovery (15 minutes)
**Goal:** Understand pain, urgency, budget

**Question 1: The Opener**
```
"So tell me about [Company] — what do you guys do, and what's your
role there?"
```
*Purpose: Let them talk, establish context*

**Question 2: The Pain Finder**
```
"What's the most repetitive task you or your team does that feels like
it could be automated but isn't?"
```
*Purpose: Identify the opportunity*

**Question 3: The Impact Dig**
```
"How much time does that take per week? What happens if nothing
changes in 6 months?"
```
*Purpose: Quantify the pain, build urgency*

**Question 4: The Priority Check**
```
"On a scale of 1-10, how important is solving this right now?
What would need to be true for it to be a 10?"
```
*Purpose: Check urgency, identify decision criteria*

**Question 5: The Budget Feel-Out**
```
"If we could solve this in 48 hours with a custom workflow, what
kind of budget are you working with?"
```
*Purpose: Check budget fit*

---

#### Value Demo (8 minutes)
**Goal:** Show, don't tell

```
"Based on what you've shared, I have a good idea of how we could help.

Let me show you something we built for [similar company] that had the
exact same challenge..."

[Share case study or quick demo]

"See, we don't do cookie-cutter stuff. Everything we build is custom
to your workflow, integrated with your existing tools, and delivered
in 48 hours."

```

---

#### Next Steps (5 minutes)
**Goal:** Get commitment

**If they're interested:**
```
"Great, I think we can definitely help.

Here's what I propose:
1. I'll send you a custom proposal within 24 hours
2. We can review it together
3. If it makes sense, we can start as early as this week

Sound good?"
```

**If they're not ready:**
```
"Totally understand. Timing is everything.

Would you mind if I sent you a free audit of your current workflows
anyway? No obligation — you might find it useful down the road.

If you're interested, just reply to my email and I'll send it over."
```

---

### Red Flags (Deal Breakers)

| Red Flag | Why | Response |
|----------|-----|----------|
| "We'll figure it out later" | No urgency | "Totally fair. When do you think this becomes a priority?" |
| Budget < $3k | Below our floor | "Thanks for being transparent. We might not be the right fit at that price point — would a discovery call for when budget opens up help?" |
| "We need an off-the-shelf solution" | We're custom | "For off-the-shelf, I'd check out [competitor]. We specialize in custom workflows." |
| Decision maker not on call | Can't close | "Would it be possible to get [decision maker] on a quick 15-minute call? I can show them exactly what we discussed." |

---

### Pricing Philosophy

**Value-Based, Not Hour-Based**

| Factor | Consideration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Time Saved** | $X hours × hourly rate × 12 months |
| **Revenue Impact** | $X additional deals × average deal size |
| **Competitive Advantage** | Speed to market, differentiation |
| **Strategic Value** | What is this worth to them? |

**Service Tiers (Clear Distinction):**

1.  **Discovery Prototype ($2,500 Fixed)**
    *   **Deliverable:** Audit + 1 Core Agent Logic (Clickable/Limited Data).
    *   **Goal:** Proof of Concept. Low risk entry.
    *   **Timeline:** 48 Hours.

2.  **Production Implementation ($5,000 - $10,000 Starting)**
    *   **Deliverable:** Full Multi-Agent System (Scout -> Research -> Writer).
    *   **Inclusions:** Live Integrations, Error Handling, Team Training.
    *   **Timeline:** 2-3 Weeks.

3.  **Monthly Retainer ($2,000 - $5,000/mo)**
    *   **Deliverable:** Ongoing optimization, new workflows, priority support.
    *   **Inclusions:** SLA (99% Uptime), Prompt Tuning, Model Upgrades.

**Never discount.** If budget is an issue, reduce scope, not price.

## 5. Closing Framework

### Follow-Up Sequence

**After Sending Proposal:**

**Email 1 (Immediately after sending):**
```
Proposal is attached!

Based on our call, I focused on [specific pain point and solution].

Let me know if you have any questions — happy to hop on another
call to walk through it.

Ready to move forward when you are.

— Rhigden
```

**Email 2 (24 hours later):**
```
Hey [Name] — any thoughts on the proposal?

If the number doesn't work, let me know and we can adjust scope.

If the timeline is too aggressive, we can push it out.

But if we're aligned, I'd love to get started this week.

— Rhigden
```

**Email 3 (48 hours later):**
```
[Name] — still interested in moving forward?

I'm blocking time for builds next week and want to make sure I have
capacity for [Company] if we're going to do this.

Let me know either way — no hard feelings if the timing's off.

— Rhigden
```

**Email 4 (72 hours later - Break up):**
```
Hey [Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming the timing isn't right.

That's completely fair.

I'll close this out for now, but if things change, just reply and
we can revisit.

Best of luck with [Company]!

— Rhigden
```

---

### Getting the Signature

**When they say "yes":**
```
"Exciting! Here's what I need from you:

1. Sign the attached MSA/SOW (electronic signature is fine)
2. 50% deposit to secure the spot (transfer details below)
3. Reply with best times for 30-min kickoff

I'll send a Cal.com link for scheduling once I have the deposit.

Target kickoff: Within 48 hours of receiving deposit.

Let's do this!
```

---

### Handling Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "It's too expensive" | "I get it. Let's look at ROI: [recap value]. If we reduce scope to [smaller project], we could do $[X]. Would that work?" |
| "Need to think about it" | "Totally fair. What specific questions do you have? I can address them now." |
| "Want other quotes" | "Smart. For comparison: [competitor] does [X], we do [Y]. We're custom, they're cookie-cutter. We deliver in 48 hours, they take months. We'll be here." |
| "The timeline is too aggressive" | "48 hours to a working prototype, not final delivery. We iterate based on your feedback. Want me to walk through the process?" |

---

## 6. Post-Sale Handoff

### Immediate Next Steps (After Deposit)

## 11. Objection Handling Framework

### Common Objections & Responses

| Objection | Root Cause | Response Strategy |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| "Too expensive" | Perceived value < price | ROI breakdown, reduce scope |
| "Need to think about it" | Uncertainty, risk | Specific questions, 30-day guarantee |
| "Want other quotes" | Due diligence, price shopping | Competitive differentiation |
| "Timeline too aggressive" | Risk aversion | 48h prototype, not final delivery |
| "Not a priority right now" | Low urgency | Cost of inaction, future reminder |

### CLOSE Framework for Objections

**C - Clarify:**
```
"When you say [objection], what specifically concerns you?"
```

**L - Listen:**
```
[Let them explain fully. Don't interrupt.]
```

**O - Objective:**
```
"So if we could address [concern], would you be ready to move forward?"
```

**S - Solve:**
```
"Here's how we can handle that: [specific solution]."
```

**E - Execute:**
```
"Does that work for you? Shall we proceed?"
```

### Scripted Responses

**"Too expensive" → ROI Breakdown:**
```
"I get it. Let's look at the numbers:

You're spending [X] hours/week on [task] at $[hourly rate]/hour.
That's $[Y]/month in wasted capacity.

Our solution costs $[price], pays for itself in [Z] months,
and saves you [X] hours every week after.

What's more expensive—solving this now or keeping the status quo?"
```

**"Need to think about it" → Specific Questions:**
```
"Totally fair. What specific questions do you have?

I'd rather address them now than have you wonder. Here are the most common:
- Timeline: 48 hours to prototype
- Support: 30 days included
- Risk: You own everything we build

What else do you need to know?"
```

**"Want other quotes" → Differentiation:**
```
"Smart to compare. Here's what you'll find:

[Competitor]: Template-based, 4-6 weeks, $[price]
[Consultant]: Strategy deck, 3 months, $[price]
DIY: 100+ hours of your time

Us: Custom built, 48 hours, working software.

We'll be here. But if you want to start saving time this week,
we can move forward."
```
