# Synto Labs Competitive Analysis

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 9, 2026
**Focus:** Understanding our position in the AI automation landscape

---

## Executive Summary

The AI automation space is fragmented between product companies (rigid, expensive), DIY tools (require dev time), and legacy consultants (slow, costly). Synto Labs wins by being **custom, fast, and transparent** — the "anti-agency agency" that moves at startup speed.

**Our Edge:** 48-hour delivery, custom workflows, build-in-public, personal brand-led.

## 8. Win/Loss Analysis

### Why We Win

| Reason | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Speed** | "48 hours vs. 3 months? Sign me up." |
| **Founder-led** | "I want to work with the person building this, not an account manager." |
| **Custom work** | "We're not like anyone else — cookie-cutter won't work." |
| **Transparency** | "I've been following your build-in-public journey — trust you." |
| **ROI focus** | "Show me the numbers. 20 hours/week saved? Yes." |

### Why We Lose

| Reason | Counter |
|--------|---------|
| **Too small / cheap** | We're not for everyone. Minimum viable project: $3k. |
| **Want off-the-shelf** | We're custom. Off-the-shelf: [competitor]. |
| **Need FTE / hiring** | We're agency, not hiring. But we can help you scale without headcount. |
| **Timing** | Fair. Follow up in 3 months, send relevant content. |
| **Internal champion** | Find the champion, arm them with ROI numbers. |
