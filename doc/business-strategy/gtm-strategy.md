```
Subject: Built this for [Company] — took 3 mins

Hey [Name],

I was researching [Company] and noticed: [specific observation about
their process/pain point].

Ran your site through our engine and found [specific insight]:
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]

No pitch, no calendar link. Just wanted you to see what's possible.

If it's useful, reply and I'll explain how we built it.

— Rhigden
```

**Email 2: Case Study (Day 3)**
```
Subject: How [Similar Company] saved 20h/week

Hey [Name],

Since we last spoke, thought you'd find this relevant:

[Similar Company] had the same challenge. We built a custom workflow
that [specific result].

Result: 20 hours/week saved, $5k/month in reclaimed capacity.

Full breakdown: [link to case study]

Want to see how this would apply to [Company]?

I'd be happy to do a free audit of your current workflows and identify
the biggest automation opportunities.

No obligation — you get the audit whether we work together or not.

Interested?

— Rhigden
```

**Email 4: Break-up (Day 14)**
```
Subject: Permission to close your file?

Hey [Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming automation isn't a priority right
now. That's completely fair.

I'll close your file so I don't keep bothering you.

If things change and you want to explore this, just reply and I'll
reopen it.

Best,
Rhigden

## 3. Sales Process: CLOSE Framework

### Overview: The CLOSE Method

We use the CLOSE framework for all sales conversations:

| Stage | Purpose | Key Actions |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **C - Connect** | Build rapport and trust | Personalized research, value-first approach |
| **L - Listen** | Understand their world | Discovery questions, pain identification |
| **O - Objective** | Define shared goals | Align on outcomes, set expectations |
| **S - Simulate** | Show, don't tell | Case studies, demos, prototype preview |
| **E - Execute** | Clear next steps | Proposal, signature, kickoff |

---

### Stage 1: Discovery Call (30 minutes)
**Goal:** Qualify fit, understand pain, build trust

#### CLOSE Framework in Action

**C - Connect (2 min)**
```
"Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. I know you're busy, so I want to respect your time.

I've spent some time researching [Company] and noticed [specific observation from research].
I have a few ideas, but I want to hear from you first.

Sound good?"
```

**L - Listen (12 min)**
**Discovery Questions:**
- "What's the most repetitive task your team does?"
- "If you could automate one thing, what would it be?"
- "What's this costing you in time or money?"
- "What happens if nothing changes in 6 months?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how important is solving this right now?"

**O - Objective (3 min)**
```
"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like [summary of pain].

If we could solve this in 48 hours with a custom workflow that [specific outcome],
would that be worth [price range] to you?"
```

**S - Simulate (8 min)**
```
"Let me show you something we built for [similar company] with the exact same challenge..."

[Share case study or quick demo]

"See, we don't do cookie-cutter stuff. Everything we build is custom to your workflow,
integrated with your existing tools, and delivered in 48 hours."
```

**E - Execute (5 min)**
```
"Great, I think we can definitely help.

Here's what I propose:
1. I'll send you a custom proposal within 24 hours
2. We can review it together
3. If it makes sense, we can start as early as this week

Sound good?"
```

#### Qualifying Framework: BANT-U

| Criteria | Question | Pass/Fail |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Budget** | "What kind of budget are you working with?" | $5k+ |
| **Authority** | "Who else needs to sign off on this?" | Decision maker in loop |
| **Need** | "What's the cost of NOT solving this?" | Clear pain quantified |
| **Timeline** | "When do you need this live?" | Within 30 days |
| **Urgency** | "Why now? Why not 6 months from now?" | Compelling reason |

#### Red Flags (Deal Breakers)
- No urgency ("we'll figure it out later")
- Budget <$3k
- Looking for off-the-shelf solutions (we're custom)
- Decision maker not on the call
- Wants RFP/vendor process (we're not a commodity vendor)

---

### Stage 2: Proposal (24 hours)
**Goal:** Custom scope, pricing, timeline

**Proposal Structure:**
1. **Problem:** What we heard (parrot back their words)
2. **Impact:** What happens if nothing changes (quantify cost)
3. **Solution:** What we'll build (specific to their workflow)
4. **Timeline:** When they'll see results (48 hours to prototype)
5. **Pricing:** Custom quote (not tiered)
6. **Risk Reversal:** 30-day support included

**Pricing Philosophy:**
- Value-based: Price based on impact, not hours
- Custom per project: No cookie-cutter packages
- Range: $5k-$15k typical, $2.5k for discovery-only

---

### Stage 3: Close (48 hours after proposal)
**Goal:** Get signed, collect deposit, schedule kickoff

**Follow-up Sequence (CLOSE Applied):**

**Email 1 (Send proposal) - Connect + Listen:**
```
"Here's what we discussed — focused on [specific pain point and solution].

I captured everything we talked about including [specific detail].

Let me know if you have questions — happy to hop on another call."
```

**Email 2 (24 hours later) - Objective:**
```
"Any thoughts on the proposal?

If the number doesn't work, let's discuss scope adjustments.
If the timeline is too aggressive, we can push it out.

But if we're aligned, I'd love to start this week."
```

**Email 3 (48 hours later) - Simulate:**
```
"I'm blocking time for builds next week.

If we move forward, here's what happens:
- Day 1: Access + kickoff
- Day 2: Agent development
- Day 3: Your prototype is live

Should I reserve a spot for [Company]?"
```

**Email 4 (72 hours later) - Execute (Break up):**
```
"Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming the timing isn't right.

That's completely fair. If things change, just reply and we can revisit."
```

**Payment Terms:**
- 50% deposit to start
- 50% on delivery
- Monthly retainers: billed upfront
- Payment methods: Wire transfer, Stripe (ACH/Credit)
