## Brand Foundation

### Brand Positioning

**Synto Labs** is a personal-brand-led AI automation agency. We are not a faceless corporation—we are Rhigden (founder) first, Synto (brand) second. We build custom multi-agent workflows that eliminate repetitive business tasks, helping B2B companies save 15+ hours per week.

### Core Identity

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Brand Essence** | Time reclaimed through intelligent automation |
| **Brand Promise** | 48-hour delivery from idea to working prototype |
| **Brand Personality** | Direct, confident, action-oriented, slightly irreverent |
| **Brand Role** | The pragmatic automation expert who delivers results |

### Mission Statement

> Deploy autonomous agent swarms that automate every phase of B2B operations—research, outreach, and closing—with perfect logic and infinite scale.

### Vision

> Become the go-to agency for AI workflow automation, helping SMBs reclaim time and scale operations without headcount increases.

## Voice & Tone

### Voice Characteristics

Our voice is **conversational but authoritative**. We know our stuff, and we don't hide behind corporate jargon.

| Trait | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct** | No fluff, no wasted words | "Automate the repetitive work" |
| **Confident** | We know what works | "48-hour delivery. Period." |
| **Action-Oriented** | Focus on doing, not discussing | "Book a call. Let's build." |
| **Value-First** | Give before asking | Free audits, transparent pricing |
| **Irreverent** | Not corporate, not stiff | "No cookie-cutter solutions" |

### Tone Spectrum

While our voice remains consistent, our tone adjusts based on context:

```
Serious/Technical          Casual/Social
│                          │
├──────────────────────────┤
│ Case Studies             │ Twitter/X
│ Proposals                │ LinkedIn casual
│ Technical Docs           │ Quick emails
│                          │
Professional yet Direct    Conversational yet Authoritative
```

### Voice Examples

**Good (On-Brand):**
- "Your team spends 15+ hours/week on repetitive tasks. Let's fix that."
- "We build custom AI workflows. Cookie-cutter solutions don't work."
- "48 hours from idea to working prototype. No bullshit."

**Bad (Off-Brand):**
- "At Synto Labs, we are passionate about leveraging synergistic AI solutions..." (Too corporate)
- "We might be able to help you maybe save some time..." (Too passive)
- "Our cutting-edge, state-of-the-art paradigm-shifting platform..." (Too buzzword-heavy)

## Key Messages

### Primary Value Proposition

> **"Automate the repetitive work."**

This is our core message. Everything else supports it.

### Supporting Messages

| Message | Context |
|---------|---------|
| "15+ hours/week saved" | Time savings for teams |
| "48-hour delivery" | Speed to value |
| "Custom built, not cookie-cutter" | Differentiation |
| "10,000+ hours saved to date" | Social proof |
| "No obligation consultation" | Risk reversal |

### Message Hierarchy

1. **Primary:** Time savings ("Automate the repetitive work")
2. **Secondary:** Speed and custom work ("48-hour delivery, custom built")
3. **Tertiary:** Social proof ("10,000+ hours saved")

### Proof Points

- 4 AI products shipped to production
- 10,000+ hours saved for end users
- 100% custom-built solutions
- 48-hour average setup time

## Writing Guidelines

### Style Rules

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Active voice only** | "We build" not "It is built" |
| **Short sentences** | Max 20 words when possible |
| **No corporate speak** | Avoid "synergy," "paradigm," "leverage" as verbs |
| **Concrete numbers** | "15+ hours" not "significant time" |
| **Second person** | "Your team" not "Companies" |

### Formatting Conventions

- **Headlines:** Sentence case, bold
- **Emphasis:** Bold for key phrases (not italics)
- **Numbers:** Digits, not words ("48" not "forty-eight")
- **Timeframes:** "48-hour" (hyphenated as adjective)
- **Prices:** "$2,500" (no spaces, comma for thousands)

### Punctuation

- **Oxford comma:** No ("agents, workflows and automation")
- **Em dashes:** Use em dashes with spaces for breaks — like this
- **Possessives:** "Client's" (singular), "Clients'" (plural)
- **Quotation marks:** Double quotes for emphasis, single for quotations within

### Words to Use

| Word | Context |
|------|---------|
| Build, ship, deliver | Action verbs |
| Automate, workflow, agents | Core concepts |
| Custom, bespoke | Differentiation |
| Hours, time, weeks | Metrics |
| Prototype, production | Stages |

### Words to Avoid

| Word | Alternative |
|------|-------------|
| Leverage | Use, build, create |
| Synergy | Collaboration, integration |
| Paradigm | Approach, method |
| Revolutionary | New, better |
| Cutting-edge | Current, modern |
| "We believe" | Just say it |

#### LinkedIn - Insight Post

```
Most AI automation projects fail because companies buy tools instead of building workflows.

Here's what actually works:

1. Start with the pain point, not the tech
2. Build for one specific use case
3. Ship in 48 hours, iterate forever

We just helped [client] cut 15 hours/week by:
- Auditing their manual [process]
- Building 3 coordinated agents
- Integrating with their existing [tool]

Cookie-cutter solutions don't work.

Custom automation does.

[Industry]: what repetitive task is eating your team's time?

#### LinkedIn - Case Study

```

- Research agent: [what it does]
- Writer agent: [what it does]

**Timeline:** 48 hours to prototype

## Brand Dos & Don'ts

### Dos

- **Be direct:** Say what you mean
- **Show proof:** Use real numbers, real case studies
- **Keep it brief:** Respect the reader's time
- **Build in public:** Share progress, failures, learnings
- **Focus on value:** Time saved, problems solved
- **Use contractions:** "Don't," "won't," "you'll"—it's conversational
- **Write like you talk:** If you wouldn't say it, don't write it

### Don'ts

- **Don't use corporate jargon:** No "synergy," "paradigm shift," "leverage"
- **Don't hedge:** "We believe," "we think," "maybe"—say it directly
- **Don't over-promise:** Under-promise, over-deliver
- **Don't be generic:** Cookie-cutter is the enemy
- **Don't hide behind "we":** Rhigden is the face, use "I" when appropriate
- **Don't use exclamation points:** One per message max, zero preferred
- **Don't be stuffy:** This isn't a law firm

### Examples

**DO:**
```
"We built a custom agent workflow. It saved them 15 hours per week.
Live in 48 hours."
