# Synto Labs Brand Guidelines

**Version:** 2.0
**Philosophy:** Direct. Confident. Action-Oriented.
**Core Promise:** We automate the work you hate.

---

## 1. Brand Identity

### Who We Are
**Synto Labs** is the pragmatic automation partner for B2B operations. We don't sell "AI magic." We sell **time**.

We build custom, multi-agent workflows that execute your repetitive tasks with military precision. Research, outreach, triage—automated, scalable, and error-proof.

### The "No-Hallucination" Guarantee
This is our moat. Most AI is a toy; ours is a tool.
> **"If it hallucinates, you don't pay."**

We use **Model-First Reasoning (MFR)** to enforce strict business logic. Our agents don't guess—they verify. This isn't just a feature; it's our promise of reliability in an unreliable industry.

### Core Values
1.  **Speed is a Feature:** 48 hours from kickoff to working prototype. Momentum kills doubt.
2.  **Custom > Cookie-Cutter:** Your business isn't generic. Your automation shouldn't be either.
3.  **Directness:** We respect your time too much to fluff the truth.
4.  **Kaizen:** We ship fast, then we make it better. Forever.

## 2. Voice & Tone

### The Synto Voice
Our voice is **The Expert Engineer**. We are the person you call when you want it done right, fast, and without the BS.

| Trait | Do This | Not That |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Direct** | "We save you 15 hours a week." | "We aim to potentially optimize your workflow efficiency." |
| **Confident** | "Our agents don't hallucinate." | "We try our best to ensure accuracy." |
| **Action** | "Book the build." | "Let's explore potential synergies." |
| **Human** | "I built this to fix my own burnout." | "Synto Labs was founded to address market inefficiencies." |

### Tone Modifiers
*   **Sales:** Aggressive on value, relaxed on pressure. (Psychology: *Authority* + *Scarcity*)
*   **Support:** Radical ownership. If it breaks, we fix it. No excuses. (Psychology: *Reciprocity*)
*   **Technical:** Precise, concise, zero jargon unless necessary. (Psychology: *Simplicity*)

## 3. Key Messaging Framework

### The Hook (Problem)
"Your best people are drowning in busywork. They're copy-pasting data, chasing leads, and sorting emails instead of closing deals."

### The Bridge (Solution)
"We deploy autonomous agent swarms that take over these tasks. They don't sleep, they don't complain, and they don't make mistakes."

### The Offer (Outcome)
*   **48-Hour Prototype:** See it work in 2 days, not 2 months.
*   **15+ Hours Saved/Week:** Real time returned to your team.
*   **MFR Guardrails:** Business logic enforced. Zero hallucinations.

### The "Why Us" (Social Proof & Authority)
*   "We don't use templates. We build for *your* stack."
*   "10,000+ hours of manual work eliminated."
*   "Powered by the same tech used by [Recognizable Tech]."

## 4. Writing Rules (The "Kill List")

**Delete these words immediately:**
*   "Synergy"
*   "Leverage" (unless mechanical)
*   "Paradigm shift"
*   "Revolutionary"
*   "Best-in-class"
*   "Delighted to"

**Use these instead:**
*   "Build"
*   "Ship"
*   "Fix"
*   "Scale"
*   "Automate"
*   "Done"

**Formatting for Impact:**
*   **Bold** your promises.
*   Use short paragraphs. (1-2 sentences).
*   Lists beat walls of text.
*   Numbers beat adjectives. ("48 hours" > "Fast")

---

## 5. Visual Identity

**Aesthetic:** Cyber-Pragmatic. Dark mode, high contrast, clean lines.
**Colors:**
*   **Void Black:** #0a0a0a (Backgrounds)
*   **Terminal Green:** #22c55e (Success, Growth)
*   **Alert Orange:** #f97316 (Action, Emphasis)
*   **Steel:** #a3a3a3 (Subtext)

**Imagery:**
*   **Do:** Clean UI screenshots, code snippets, architectural diagrams.
*   **Don't:** Stock photos of people shaking hands, abstract 3D blobs, "tech" blue gradients.

## 6. Communication Templates

### Cold Email (The "Specific Pain" Pattern)
**Subject:** 15 hours/week. Gone.

"[Name],

I see you're hiring for [Role]. Usually, that means your team is drowning in [Specific Task].

We built an agent that handles [Specific Task] autonomously. It verifies data, writes emails, and updates your CRM. No humans involved.

It saves [Competitor/Similar Co] about 15 hours a week.

I can build you a working prototype in 48 hours. If it doesn't work, you don't pay.

Open to a 10-min demo?

### Proposal (The "No Brainer")
**Subject:** Proposal: Automating [Process]

"[Name],

Here is the plan to eliminate [Pain Point] from your daily operations.

**The Build:**
1.  **Scout Agent:** Finds the data.
2.  **Logic Core:** Filters and verifies (MFR enabled).
3.  **Action Agent:** Executes the outreach.

**The Promise:**
*   **Timeline:** Working demo in 48 hours.
*   **Cost:** $[Price].
*   **Guarantee:** If it hallucinates, refund.

**Next Steps:**
Sign attached. We kick off Thursday.

## 7. Brand Guardrails (Dos & Don'ts)

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| **Own the outcome.** "We fixed it." | **Pass the buck.** "The API was down." |
| **Be expensive.** Quality costs money. | **Discount.** Price signals value. |
| **Show the work.** Demo > Deck. | **Tell a story.** Results > Narrative. |
| **Fire bad clients.** Protect the team. | **Beg for business.** Desperation smells. |

*Move fast. Fix things. Automate everything.*
