## 8. Brand Voice Guidelines

> **Full brand guidelines available at:** `/doc/marketing/brand-guidelines.md`

### Core Voice Characteristics

Our voice is **conversational but authoritative**. We know our stuff, and we don't hide behind corporate jargon.

| Trait | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct** | No fluff, no wasted words | "Automate the repetitive work" |
| **Confident** | We know what works | "48-hour delivery. Period." |
| **Action-Oriented** | Focus on doing, not discussing | "Book a call. Let's build." |
| **Value-First** | Give before asking | Free audits, transparent pricing |
| **Irreverent** | Not corporate, not stiff | "No cookie-cutter solutions" |

### Tone Spectrum

While our voice remains consistent, our tone adjusts based on context:

```
Serious/Technical          Casual/Social
│                          │
├──────────────────────────┤
│ Case Studies             │ Twitter/X
│ Proposals                │ LinkedIn casual
│ Technical Docs           │ Quick emails
│                          │
Professional yet Direct    Conversational yet Authoritative
```

### Core Principles

1. **Authentic over polished** - Real > Perfect
2. **Specific over generic** - Numbers > Adjectives
3. **Actionable over theoretical** - How > What
4. **Conversational over corporate** - Human > Professional
5. **Transparent over guarded** - Share losses, not just wins

### Style Rules

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Active voice only** | "We build" not "It is built" |
| **Short sentences** | Max 20 words when possible |
| **No corporate speak** | Avoid "synergy," "paradigm," "leverage" as verbs |
| **Concrete numbers** | "15+ hours" not "significant time" |
| **Second person** | "Your team" not "Companies" |

### Formatting Conventions

- **Headlines:** Sentence case, bold
- **Emphasis:** Bold for key phrases (not italics)
- **Numbers:** Digits, not words ("48" not "forty-eight")
- **Timeframes:** "48-hour" (hyphenated as adjective)
- **Prices:** "$2,500" (no spaces, comma for thousands)

### Signature Sign-Offs

| Context | Sign-Off |
|---------|----------|
| **Formal** | "Best, Rhigden" |
| **Casual** | "Best," or "Rhigden" |
| **Email** | "Best, Rhigden" |
| **Twitter** | No sign-off needed |

### Do's and Don'ts

**Do:**
- Use specific numbers (20 hours, not "a lot")
- Share failures and lessons learned
- Show behind-the-scenes
- Write like you talk
- Use contractions ("don't," "won't," "you'll")
- Include screenshots and visuals
- Be concise (respect attention)

**Don't:**
- Use buzzwords without explanation
- Gatekeep valuable insights
- Fake perfection
- Use clickbait titles
- Over-post (quality > quantity)
- Sell in every post
- Use exclamation points (one per message max, zero preferred)
- Hedge with "we believe," "we think," "maybe"

### Voice Examples

**Good (On-Brand):**
- "Your team spends 15+ hours/week on repetitive tasks. Let's fix that."
- "We build custom AI workflows. Cookie-cutter solutions don't work."
- "48 hours from idea to working prototype. No bullshit."

**Bad (Off-Brand):**
- "At Synto Labs, we are passionate about leveraging synergistic AI solutions..." (Too corporate)
- "We might be able to help you maybe save some time..." (Too passive)
- "Our cutting-edge, state-of-the-art paradigm-shifting platform..." (Too buzzword-heavy)

**Too generic:**
"We help companies automate their workflows and save time."

**Better (specific):**
"We built a multi-agent system that qualifies leads automatically. Result: 20 hours saved/week for our client."

**Too corporate:**
"Our proprietary methodology leverages advanced AI to optimize operational efficiency."

**Better (conversational):**
"Here's how we automated lead qualification using AI agents — and how you can do it too."

## 13. Content Quality Checklist

> **Use this checklist before publishing any content**

### Brand Voice Alignment
- [ ] Written in active voice (not passive)
- [ ] Sentences under 20 words where possible
- [ ] No corporate jargon ("synergy," "paradigm," "leverage")
- [ ] Uses specific numbers (not "significant," "many")
- [ ] Written in second person ("your team," not "companies")
- [ ] Conversational tone (read it aloud — does it sound natural?)

### Value Test
- [ ] Reader gets specific, actionable insight
- [ ] Not a sales pitch in disguise
- [ ] Includes real metrics or examples
- [ ] Clear takeaway even if they don't buy

### Formatting Check
- [ ] Headlines in sentence case, bold
- [ ] Emphasis uses bold (not italics)
- [ ] Numbers as digits ("48" not "forty-eight")
- [ ] Timeframes hyphenated ("48-hour")
- [ ] Prices formatted correctly ("$2,500")
- [ ] No exclamation points (or maximum 1)

### Platform-Specific Checks

**Twitter/X:**
- [ ] Under 280 characters per tweet
- [ ] Thread numbered correctly (1/N, 2/N, etc.)
- [ ] Hashtags minimal (0-2 max)
- [ ] Clear value in first tweet
- [ ] CTA only in final tweet

**LinkedIn:**
- [ ] Compelling headline (bolded)
- [ ] White space between sections
- [ ] Bulleted lists for readability
- [ ] Relevant hashtags at end (#AI #Automation)
- [ ] Discussion question at end

**Blog:**
- [ ] SEO-optimized title
- [ ] Meta description included
- [ ] Internal links to related content
- [ ] Clear CTA at end
- [ ] Author bio with link

### Pre-Publish Questions
1. Would I share this if I didn't write it?
2. Does this deliver value even if the reader never buys?
3. Is one key insight crystal clear?
4. Would Rhigden actually say this in conversation?
5. Are all claims verifiable or clearly framed as opinion?

### Reader Testing Outcomes

**Before publishing, ask a trusted reader:**
- What's the main takeaway? (Should match your intent)
- What action would you take based on this? (Should be specific)
- Did anything confuse you? (Fix ambiguities)
- Was it worth your time? (If no, revise)
