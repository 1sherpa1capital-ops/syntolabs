**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 10, 2026
**Framework:** ORB + 5-Phase Launch
**Goal:** Build momentum for the Synto Labs agency brand beyond cold outreach.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy

A service business launch isn't a single day—it's a crescendo of credibility. We aren't just "opening for business"; we are **productizing our service** to create a launchable event.

**Our Launch Vehicle:** The "48-Hour Workflow Prototype" (Productized Service)

## 2. The ORB Channel Strategy

Structure the launch marketing across three channel types to drive traffic to our Owned assets.

### Owned Channels (The Destination)
*   **Website (`syntolabs.xyz`):** The conversion engine. Needs a dedicated "Launch Offer" landing page.
*   **Newsletter:** Launching the "Synto Dispatch" – bi-weekly deep dives into automation.
*   **Personal Brand (Rhigden):** While on rented platforms, the *relationship* is owned. Direct DMs and "notify me" lists.

### Rented Channels (The Megaphone)
*   **Twitter/X:** The "Build-in-Public" engine. Daily threads documenting the build of the agency itself.
*   **LinkedIn:** The "Credibility" engine. High-polish case studies targeting decision-makers.
*   **Product Hunt:** Launching a free tool (e.g., "AI ROI Calculator") to drive top-of-funnel traffic.

### Borrowed Channels (The Shortcut)
*   **Client Case Studies:** Leveraging the networks of Chessy, GetBeezy, and Musashi. "See what we built for [Influential Founder]."
*   **Podcast Appearances:** Targeting niche B2B SaaS podcasts to talk about "The Death of Busywork."

## 3. The 5-Phase Launch Timeline

### Phase 1: Internal Validation (Weeks 1-2)

*   **Offer:** "I'll build you a prototype. If you don't like it, you don't pay." (Risk Reversal).
*   **Marketing:** "Stealth Mode" teases on Twitter. "Something is cooking..."

### Phase 3: Beta Launch - "The Waitlist" (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal:** Build scarcity and demand.
*   **Action:** Put up a "Waitlist" on `syntolabs.xyz`.
*   **Mechanism:** "We only accept 4 clients per month to maintain quality."

**Goal:** Convert waitlist to revenue.
*   **Action:** Open 5 spots to the waitlist via email.
*   **Offer:** "Founding Member" pricing (Lock in $2.5k retainer rate for 6 months).

### Phase 5: Full Launch - "Public Availability" (Week 9+)
**Goal:** Maximum visibility.

## 5. Post-Launch Momentum

Don't let the hype die.

1.  **The "Sold Out" Pivot:** If we fill capacity, immediately switch messaging to "Join the Waitlist for Next Month." Scarcity drives demand.
2.  **The "Build-in-Public" Recap:** Share the numbers. "We launched. Here's exactly how much revenue we made, how many leads we got, and what broke."
3.  **Client Wins:** As soon as a Launch client gets a win, publish it. "Day 3 with [New Client]: Already saved 5 hours."
