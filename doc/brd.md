### 5.2 Pricing Philosophy

1.  **Value-Based Pricing**: Price based on value delivered (time saved, revenue impact), not hours worked.
2.  **Tiered Access**: Lower entry point ($2.5k) reduces friction, with clear upsell path to Retainer.
3.  **Retainer Incentive**: Hourly rates are 20% higher for non-retainer clients to drive recurring revenue.
4.  **No Discounts**: Reduce scope, never price. Protects brand value.
