## 5. Communication Templates

### 5.1 Cold Email Structure

**Email 1: Value-First (No Pitch)**
```
Subject: Built this for [Company] — might save you $[X]/mo

Hey —

I was researching [Company] and noticed something familiar:
[Specific pain point observation].

So I ran your site through our engine. Result: a 12-page strategy deck in 181 seconds.
Scraped [X] pages, found [X] decision makers, calculated ~$[X]/mo in potential savings.

The demo is attached. No pitch, no calendar link, no follow-up sequence.
Just wanted you to see what's possible.

If it's useful, reply and I'll explain how we built it.
If not, no worries — keep the demo.

— Rhigden
Founder, Synto Labs
```

**Email 2: Case Study**
```
Subject: How [Similar Company] saved [X] hours/week

Hi [Name],

Thought you might find this relevant: [Similar Company] had the same challenge
with [specific problem].

We built a [specific workflow] that automated [process]. Result: [X] hours/week saved
and [Y]$ in monthly labor costs.

Case study attached. Happy to walk through how it would apply to [Company].

Best,
Rhigden
```

**Email 3: Soft Offer**
```

**Email 4: Break-Up**

Totally understand — timing is everything.

I'll keep [Company] on my radar in case things change. Feel free to reach out anytime.

Rhigden
```

### 5.2 Discovery Call Script

**Opening (2 min):**
> "Thanks for booking time. I've got 30 minutes allocated. Quick background—I build AI agent swarms that automate repetitive business tasks. Before we dive in, what's the one task that eats your team's time that you wish would just... disappear?"

**Pain Discovery (10 min):**
> "Tell me about that process. Who does it now? How often? What happens when it goes wrong? What's the cost—time or money—when it's not done well?"

**Opportunity Sizing (10 min):**
> "So if I'm hearing you right: [repeat back]. That's roughly [X] hours/week at [Y]$/hour. If we automated 80% of that, you'd reclaim [Z] hours and save $[W]/month. Is that math right?"

**Next Steps (5 min):**
> "Here's what I recommend: I'll build a custom prototype for [Company] that addresses [specific pain]. 48-hour turnaround, $2,500. If you love it, we implement. If not, you keep the IP. Sound fair?"

**Closing (3 min):**
> "Let's get you booked for [specific date]. I'll send over a scope and payment link. Anything else before we wrap?"

### 5.3 Social Media Voice Guidelines

**Twitter/X:**
- Build-in-public philosophy

- Thread format for deep dives
- Engage with replies, not just broadcasts

**LinkedIn:**
- Weekly deep-dive posts (1-2x/week)
- Case study breakdowns with numbers
- Professional but conversational tone
- Comment on relevant posts with value, not self-promotion

**Example Post Structure:**
```
[Hook: Specific pain or surprising stat]

[Context: Why this matters for B2B]

[Solution: How we approach it]

[Proof: Specific numbers or case]

[CTA: Soft ask or discussion starter]
```

## 6. BrandGuardrails (MFR for Brand)

### 6.1 No-Hallucination Guarantee

Never:
- Claim capabilities we haven't shipped
- Promise specific ROI without data to back it
- Overstate or exaggerate results

Always:
- Under-promise, over-deliver
- Use specific numbers from real projects
- Qualify estimates as "projected" or "typical"

### 6.2 Adaptive Outcome Logic

Adjust messaging based on:
- **Prospect stage**: Cold (value-first) → Warm (social proof) → Hot (urgency)
- **Industry**: SaaS (pipeline focus) vs. Agency (delivery focus) vs. Services (time focus)
- **Role**: Founder (growth/VC) vs. Ops (efficiency) vs. Sales (revenue)

### 6.3 Deep Context Retention

Remember and reference:
- Previous conversations and specifics shared
- Company details from research
- Personal details (role, background)
- Past projects and case studies relevant to their industry
