# Synto Labs Subcontractor Guidelines

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 9, 2026  
**Model:** Ad-hoc, on-demand engagement

---

## 1. Engagement Model

### Philosophy

**We engage subcontractors on an ad-hoc, as-needed basis.** No full-time commitments, no retainers (unless explicitly agreed). You work when we have work, we pay for deliverables.

### How It Works

1. **Project comes in** → We assess if we need subcontractor help
2. **Scope defined** → Clear deliverables, timeline, budget
3. **Subcontractor engaged** → You work, we track progress
4. **Deliverables reviewed** → Feedback, revisions if needed
5. **Payment processed** → Within 7 days of acceptance

---

## 2. Subcontractor Roles

| Role | Rate | When Needed | Typical Tasks |
|------|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Frontend Developer** | $75-100/hour | Custom dashboards, UI tools | React dashboards, data viz |
| **Backend Developer** | $100-150/hour | Complex integrations, API work | CRM integrations, webhooks |
| **Voice/AI Specialist** | $100-125/hour | Voice agent implementations | Bland AI, Vapi.ai setups |
| **Video Editor** | $50-75/hour | Demo videos, case study content | Screen recordings, edits |

---

## 8. Intellectual Property

### Ownership

**Client owns:**
- The specific code built for their project
- Custom configurations for their workflow
- Any client-specific data or content

**Synto Labs owns:**
- Reusable components and patterns
- General agent frameworks
- Learnings and best practices

**You retain:**
- Rights to your general expertise
- Rights to reusable code libraries (before client customization)

### Non-Compete

During active engagement and for 3 months after:
- Don't work with our direct competitors on similar AI automation projects
- Don't use our proprietary MFR guardrails or frameworks
- Don't share our client lists or project details

---

## 9. Confidentiality

### What's Confidential

- Client names and project details
- Our MFR guardrail implementation
- Our pricing and margins
- Our subcontractor rates (don't discuss with others)

### Duration

Confidentiality obligation continues indefinitely for trade secrets, 2 years for other confidential info.

---

## 10. Performance Expectations

### What We Expect

- **Quality:** Professional-grade work
- **Communication:** Responsive and transparent
- **Reliability:** Meet deadlines or communicate early
- **Integrity:** Ask questions when uncertain

### Red Flags

These behaviors would end our relationship:
- Missing deadlines without communication
- Poor quality requiring significant rework
- Sharing confidential information
- Ghosting (unresponsive for >48 hours)

### Feedback Process

We'll provide feedback on deliverables:
- **First time:** Constructive, specific
- **Second time:** Clear expectations
- **Third time:** May end engagement if not resolved

---

## 11. Scope Changes

### Handling Scope Creep

If you discover the project scope is larger than understood:

1. **Communicate immediately** — Don't wait until deadline
2. **Explain the issue** — What's different, why it matters
3. **Propose options** — Timeline extension, budget increase, or scope reduction

We'll discuss and decide together.

### Change Orders

Significant scope changes require:
- Written agreement (email is fine)
- Adjusted timeline and/or budget
- Client approval (if billable to them)

---

## 12. Tools & Access

### Tools We Use

| Tool | Purpose | Your Access |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **GitHub** | Code repository | Read/write on project repos |
| **Linear** | Task tracking | Read-only (or write if PM role) |
| **Notion** | Documentation | Read-only on project docs |
| **Slack** | Communication | If added to workspace |

### Getting Access

When engaged for a project:
- You'll receive GitHub invite
- Notion link if relevant documentation
- Slack invite if active collaboration needed

### Returning Access

After project completion:
- GitHub access removed (or transfer to client)
- Revoked from client-specific Slack channels
- You keep access to any general Synto Labs channels

---

## 13. Dispute Resolution

### Process

1. **Raise the issue** — Email rhigden@syntolabs.xyz
2. **We'll discuss** — Call or email within 24 hours
3. **Resolve** — Find mutually acceptable solution

### Escalation

If unresolved:
- Third-party mediation (split cost)
- Final decision by Rhigden (as business owner)

---

## 14. Ending Engagement

### Voluntary End

Either party can end engagement with:
- 7 days notice for ongoing projects
- Completion of current project deliverables
- Outstanding payments processed

### Involuntary End

We may end engagement immediately for:
- Confidentiality breach
- Ghosting (unresponsive >72 hours)
- Substandard quality after feedback
- Ethical misconduct

---

## 15. Future Opportunities

### Re-engagement

Good work = More opportunities

We maintain a roster of trusted subcontractors and prioritize:
- Those who deliver quality on time
- Those who communicate well
- Those who embrace our philosophy (fast, custom, transparent)

### Referrals

If you know others who'd be good subcontractors:
- Refer them and we'll pay $500 referral fee if they complete 3 projects
- We're always looking for specialists in AI, voice, video
