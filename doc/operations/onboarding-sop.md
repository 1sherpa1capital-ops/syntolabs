# Synto Labs Client Onboarding SOP

**Version:** 2.0
**Philosophy:** 48-Hour Sprint. Zero Friction. Maximum Impact.
**Core Principle:** Under-Promise. Over-Deliver.

---

## 1. The Workflow Overview

**Speed is trust.** We move from "interested" to "working prototype" in days, not weeks.

**Timeline:**
*   **Day 0:** Discovery Call (Qualify)
*   **Day 1:** Proposal Sent (Price/Scope)
*   **Day 2:** Kickoff (Access/Build Start)
*   **Day 4:** Prototype Delivered (Demo)
*   **Day 5+:** Refine & Deploy

---

## 2. Phase 1: Discovery Call (30 min)

**Goal:** Qualify pain, budget, and urgency. Get commitment.

**Pre-Call Checklist:**
*   [ ] Research prospect (LinkedIn, recent news).
*   [ ] Check existing tools (BuiltWith/Wappalyzer).
*   [ ] Review relevant case study.

**The Script (Psychology: *Pain Agitation*):**
1.  **Opener:** "What's the one repetitive task your team hates the most?"
2.  **Dig:** "How many hours a week does that eat up? What is that costing you in lost deals/productivity?"
3.  **Vision:** "If we could automate that completely—no humans involved—what would you do with those 15 hours?"
4.  **Check:** "Does solving this become a priority *this month*?"
5.  **Budget:** "Our custom builds start at $3k. Does that fit your budget to fix this problem permanently?"

**Qualification (BANT):**
*   **Budget:** Can they afford $3k+?
*   **Authority:** Can they sign?
*   **Need:** Is the pain real/urgent?
*   **Timeline:** Do they want it now?

**Action:** Send recap email within 1 hour.

## 3. Phase 2: Proposal (24 Hours)

**Goal:** Signed contract + 50% deposit.

**The Offer (Psychology: *Risk Reversal*):**
*   **Scope:** Clear deliverables (e.g., "1 Scout Agent, 1 Research Agent, 1 Action Agent").
*   **Timeline:** "Working prototype in 48 hours from kickoff."
*   **Investment:** Fixed price. No hourly billing.
*   **Guarantee:** "If it doesn't work as promised, you don't pay."

**Follow-Up Sequence:**
1.  **Immediate:** "Proposal attached. I focused on [Pain Point]. Let's fix this."
2.  **24h:** "Any questions? If the scope is off, let me know. Happy to adjust."
3.  **48h:** "Holding build slots for next week. Are we moving forward?"
4.  **72h (Breakup):** "Haven't heard back. Assuming timing isn't right. Closing file."

---

## 4. Phase 3: Kickoff (30-60 min)

**Goal:** Access gathered. Scope locked. Sprint starts NOW.

**The commitment (Psychology: *Consistency*):**
"We are starting the build immediately after this call. I need your team ready to test in 48 hours."

**Agenda:**
1.  **Confirm Scope:** "We are building [X] to solve [Y]. Correct?"
2.  **Access Gathering (Streamlined):**
    *   **CRM:** API Key / Invite
    *   **Email/Calendar:** OAuth / Service Account
    *   **Docs:** Brand Voice, Templates, Rules
3.  **Next Steps:** "You will see a working prototype on [Date/Time]."

**Post-Kickoff Action:**
*   [ ] Verify all access credentials immediately.
*   [ ] Create project channel (Slack/Teams).
*   [ ] Send "Build Started" confirmation email.

---

## 5. Phase 4: Build (The 48-Hour Sprint)

**Goal:** Production-ready prototype.

**Communication (Psychology: *Transparency*):**
Send **Daily Updates**:
*   **Progress:** "Built Scout agent. Connected CRM."
*   **Blockers:** "Need API key for [Tool]." (If any)
*   **Plan:** "Testing email outreach flow tomorrow."
*   **ETA:** "Demo scheduled for [Date/Time]."

## 6. Phase 5: Deploy & Handover

**Goal:** Live system. Trained team.

**The Demo:**
1.  **Show:** "Here is the agent doing the work." (Live run)
2.  **Tell:** "It found [X], verified [Y], and sent [Z]."
3.  **Ask:** "Is this output accurate?"

**Handover Package:**
*   [ ] **User Guide:** Simple PDF/Notion doc.
*   [ ] **Video Walkthrough:** 5-min Loom.
*   [ ] **Support Access:** Email/Slack for 30 days.

**Action:** Deploy to production environment.

## 7. Phase 6: Support & Feedback (Kaizen Loop)

**Goal:** Optimization & Referral.

**Support Schedule:**
*   **Week 1:** Daily check-ins. Fix bugs fast.
*   **Day 30:** ROI Review.

**The ROI Review (Psychology: *Social Proof/Referral*):**
1.  **Measure:** "We saved you [X] hours this month."
2.  **Ask:** "Who else do you know with this problem?"
3.  **Upsell:** "We can also automate [Adjacent Task]. Interested?"

## 8. Red Flags & Escalation

**Stop Work Immediately If:**
*   Client is abusive or disrespectful.
*   Scope creeps significantly without budget adjustment.
*   Access is consistently blocked/delayed.
*   Payment is late.

**Escalation Path:**
1.  **Delivery Lead:** Try to resolve directly.
2.  **Founder:** Step in for commercial/relationship issues.

*Move fast. Deliver value. Automate everything.*
