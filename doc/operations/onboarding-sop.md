## 1. Delivery Philosophy

### Core Principles

| Principle | What It Means | How We Apply It |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **48-Hour Prototype** | Working demo within 48 hours of kickoff | Aggressive scoping, MVP-first approach |
| **Move Fast, Break Things** | Ship imperfect solutions, iterate quickly | Test in production, fix fast |
| **Under-Promise, Over-Deliver** | Set realistic expectations, exceed them | Quote 2 weeks, deliver in 10 days |
| **Radical Transparency** | No surprises, open communication | Daily updates, blockers shared immediately |

### The 48-Hour Promise

```
Hour 0-24: Access gathering + tool audit
Hour 24-36: Agent development + basic testing
Hour 36-48: Working prototype delivery + demo
```

**What "48-Hour Prototype" Means:**
- NOT final, polished production system
- YES working agent that demonstrates core value
- YES integrated with their actual tools/data
- YES ready for feedback and iteration

Proposal is attached!

Based on our call, I focused on [specific pain point and solution].

Let me know if you have any questions — happy to hop on another
call to walk through it.

Ready to move forward when you are.

— Rhigden
```

**Email 2 (24 hours later):**
```
Hey [Name] — any thoughts on the proposal?

If the number doesn't work, let me know and we can adjust scope.

If the timeline is too aggressive, we can push it out.

But if we're aligned, I'd love to get started this week.

— Rhigden
```

**Email 3 (48 hours later):**
```
[Name] — still interested in moving forward?

I'm blocking time for builds next week and want to make sure I have
capacity for [Company] if we're going to do this.

Let me know either way — no hard feelings if the timing's off.

— Rhigden
```

**Email 4 (72 hours later - Break up):**
```
Hey [Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming the timing isn't right.

That's completely fair.

I'll close this out for now, but if things change, just reply and
we can revisit.

Best of luck with [Company]!

— Rhigden
```

## 10. Red Flags & Escalation

### Project Red Flags

| Red Flag | Severity | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Client stops responding | High | Email + call within 24 hours |
| Scope creep detected | Medium | Document, discuss change orders |
| Technical blocker | High | Escalate immediately, transparent communication |
| Access not granted | High | Block progress until received |
| Client unhappy with output | High | Stop, listen, pivot if needed |

### Scope Creep Response Template

```
Hey [Name] —

Great idea! I can definitely see how [requested feature] would be
valuable.

Just to confirm: this is outside our original scope of [original scope].

I have two options:

1. **Add it to the project**: This would add [X] days and cost $[Y]
2. **Add to phase 2**: We can tackle this after the initial delivery

Which would you prefer?

— Rhigden
```

### Escalation Path

1. **Developer can't solve technical issue**
   → Escalate to founder immediately
   → Transparent communication with client

2. **Client requests significant changes**
   → Pause development
   → Discuss scope/timeline implications
   → Get confirmation before proceeding

3. **Timeline at risk**
   → Inform client immediately
   → Provide options (reduce scope, extend timeline, add resources)
   → Never surprise at deadline
