## Overview

Synto Labs operates as a lean AI automation agency. We scale through ad-hoc subcontractor engagement rather than full-time hires. This document outlines our engagement philosophy, roles, requirements, and operational standards.

---

## Engagement Philosophy

### Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **On-Demand** | Engage subcontractors only when client work requires specialized skills |
| **No Long-Term Commitments** | Project-based work with clear scopes and deliverables |
| **Scale with Revenue** | Subcontractor costs tracked per project; margins protected |
| **Quality Over Speed** | Deliverables must meet standards; revisions expected |

### What We Are NOT

- ❌ An employer (subcontractors are independent contractors)
- ❌ A steady paycheck source (work ebbs and flows)
- ❌ A training ground (we expect expertise, not learning projects)

## Onboarding Process

### Step 1: Initial Qualification

Before any work begins:

- [ ] Portfolio review (relevant past work)
- [ ] Rate confirmation
- [ ] Availability check
- [ ] NDA signed (see below)

### Step 2: Project Scoping

For each engagement:

- [ ] Clear SOW with deliverables
- [ ] Timeline with milestones
- [ ] Budget cap established
- [ ] Communication cadence agreed

### Step 3: Execution Standards

- Weekly progress updates required
- All code committed to repo with proper access
- Deliverables tested before submission
- Documentation provided for handoff

---

## Legal Requirements

### NDA (Required Before Work)

All subcontractors must sign a Mutual NDA covering:
- Client information (business processes, data)
- Synto Labs proprietary methods and tooling
- Project details and pricing

### Independent Contractor Status

Subcontractors are NOT employees. Key distinctions:
- No benefits, insurance, or tax withholding
- Provide own tools and workspace
- Control work methods within deliverable requirements
- May work for other clients (including competitors)

### IP Assignment

All work product created for Synto Labs clients becomes client property upon payment. Subcontractors:
- Assign all IP rights to Synto Labs (or directly to client)
- May not reuse client-specific code/logic for other projects
- May use general techniques and patterns learned

---

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality

| Standard | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Testing** | Unit tests for business logic; integration tests for APIs |
| **Documentation** | README with setup instructions; inline comments for complex logic |
| **Version Control** | Clear commit messages; feature branches |
| **Code Review** | Founder reviews all code before client delivery |

### Communication Standards

| Cadence | Expectation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Daily** | Slack/async updates for blockers |
| **Weekly** | Progress summary, upcoming work |
| **Per Milestone** | Demo of completed work |

### Revision Policy

- **2 rounds of revisions included** in project scope
- Additional revisions billed hourly
- Scope changes require SOW amendment and client approval

---

## Payment Terms

### Standard Terms

| Term | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Payment Schedule** | Net 15 (invoiced upon milestone completion) |
| **Payment Method** | Stripe transfer, Wise, or check |
| **Late Payment** | 1.5% monthly fee after 30 days |
| **Kill Fee** | 50% of agreed budget if project cancelled mid-work |

## Engagement Triggers

When to bring in a subcontractor by role:

| Situation | Role to Engage |
|-----------|----------------|
| Client needs custom dashboard with real-time data | Frontend Developer |
| Integration with Salesforce/HubSpot required | Backend Developer |
| Client wants voice agents for inbound qualification | Voice/AI Specialist |
| Case study video needed for website/portfolio | Video Editor |
| Project requires >40 hours/week of development | Any role (split work) |

---

## Performance Expectations

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **On-Time Delivery** | 90% of milestones hit by deadline |
| **Revision Rate** | <1.5 rounds average revisions |
| **Client Satisfaction** | No client complaints about subcontractor work |
| **Code Quality** | No critical bugs post-delivery |

### Re-engagement Criteria

Subcontractors meeting standards get priority for future work:
- Reliable communication
- Quality deliverables
- Reasonable revision responsiveness
- Professional conduct

### Non-Renewal

We may not re-engage for:
- Missed deadlines without communication
- Quality issues requiring founder rework
- Poor communication (ghosting, delayed responses)
- Scope creep without approval
