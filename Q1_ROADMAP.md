---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### Week 1: Brand Architecture

**Day 1-2: Define Your Unique Angle**
- [ ] Write your origin story: "How a non-technical international student became a vibe coder"
- [ ] Identify 3-5 content pillars based on your intersection:
  1. **Building in Public** - Documenting Mercer growth with real numbers
  2. **Data-Driven Creativity** - Using analytics to improve content
  3. **Psychology of Attention** - Why people engage with content
  4. **Creator Economics** - Monetization strategies for creators
  5. **Vibe Coding** - Non-technical founder journey

**Day 3-4: Platform Setup**
- [ ] **Twitter/X:** Optimize bio with clear value prop
  - Bio formula: "Building [product] | [unique angle] | [credibility] | [CTA]"
  - Example: "Building Mercer (AI for Med Spas) | Teaching creators data-driven content | Non-technical founder | DM 'growth' for free guide"
- [ ] **LinkedIn:** Professional positioning
  - Headline: "Helping creators use data to grow | Building Mercer"
  - Featured section: Best content + Mercer link
- [ ] **Substack:** Set up newsletter
  - Name: "The Data-Driven Creator" or "Vibe Coder Weekly"
  - First post: Your manifesto + origin story
- [ ] **YouTube:** Create channel (start with shorts/reels first)

**Day 5-7: Content Systems**
- [ ] Set up Notion/Airtable for content calendar
- [ ] Create templates for each content type
- [ ] Batch create 10 pieces of content for launch week

### Week 2: Soft Launch

**Content to Publish:**

**Twitter/X (Daily):**
- Day 1: Origin story thread (5-7 tweets)
- Day 2: Hot take on content creation
- Day 3: Behind-the-scenes of Mercer
- Day 4: Data insight from your niche

---

## Phase 2: Content Engine (Weeks 3-6)

### Psychology-Backed Content Strategy

Apply these mental models to maximize engagement:

**1. The Zeigarnik Effect (Open Loops)**
- Start threads with incomplete thoughts: "I discovered something that changed how I create content..."
- End tweets with questions that create tension
- Use cliffhangers: "Part 2 tomorrow"

**2. Mimetic Desire**
- Show what successful creators are doing (people want what others want)
- Use social proof: "This is how creators with 100K+ followers think"
- Quote influential people (Theo, Dan Koe, Hormozi)

**3. Availability Heuristic**
- Make your content easy to remember and recall
- Use concrete examples, not abstract concepts
- Create memorable frameworks with names ("The Data-Driven Creator Method")

**4. Loss Aversion**
- Frame content around what they'll lose by not knowing: "The mistake costing you 1000 followers"
- "Don't waste 6 months like I did..."
- "Stop losing leads to your competitors"

**5. Reciprocity**
- Give massive value before asking for anything
- Free templates, frameworks, tools
- "Save this thread" content

**Cold Email/Calling Strategy (Current Method):**

**Target:** Med Spa owners, aesthetic clinics

**Email Sequence:**

**Email 1 - Value First:**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Clinic Name]'s booking process

Hi [Name],

I came across [Clinic Name] while researching top Med Spas in Toronto. 

Quick question: Are you currently running Meta/Instagram ads?

I ask because I built a tool that helps Med Spas capture more leads from their ads by ensuring every call gets answered 24/7.

I noticed [specific observation about their current setup - e.g., "your booking page loads slowly on mobile" or "I called and got voicemail at 7pm"].

Happy to share a quick 2-minute video showing how this works for clinics like yours.

Best,
Rhigden
```

**Email 2 - Follow-up (3 days later):**
```
Subject: Re: Quick question about [Clinic Name]'s booking process

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note from a few days ago about capturing more leads from your ads.

I recorded a quick 90-second demo specifically for [Clinic Name] showing how an AI receptionist could handle after-hours inquiries.

[Link to Loom video]

Worth a 2-minute look?

Rhigden
```

**Email 3 - Breakup (7 days later):**
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume now's not the right time.

If you're ever interested in capturing more leads from your ads (especially those 6pm-9pm inquiries), feel free to reach out.

I also write a weekly newsletter on marketing psychology for Med Spas - happy to add you if interested.

Best,
Rhigden
```

### Lead Nurture Email Sequence (For Prospects Who Engage)

**Goal:** Build relationship and demonstrate value over 21 days

**Email 1: Value Delivery (Day 1)**
```
Subject: The 3-minute Med Spa lead audit

Hi [Name],

Thanks for your interest in Mercer.

I put together a quick audit you can run on your clinic in 3 minutes:

1. Call your clinic after hours (7pm). Do you get voicemail?
2. Check your Meta ad leads from last week. How many called vs. filled out forms?
3. Ask your front desk: "How many calls did you miss yesterday?"

Most Med Spas I talk to are shocked by #3.

If you want, I can run a more detailed audit for [Clinic Name]—just reply and I'll send over the results.

Rhigden
```

**Email 2: Social Proof (Day 4)**
```
Subject: How [Similar Clinic] recovered $15K in lost bookings

Hi [Name],

Quick story:

[Similar Clinic Name] in [City] was spending $4K/month on Meta ads but missing 40% of calls.

Most came in after 6pm when their front desk was gone.

They implemented an AI receptionist in 48 hours.

Result: Captured 23 additional consultations in month 1 = $15K+ in recovered revenue.

Want to see if the same math works for [Clinic Name]?

I can show you the exact setup—just reply "demo" and I'll send a 2-minute video.

Rhigden
```

**Email 3: Objection Handler (Day 8)**
```
Subject: "Will this sound robotic?" (and 3 other questions)

Hi [Name],

I get these questions a lot:

**Q: Will this sound robotic to my patients?**
A: Modern AI sounds natural—most callers don't realize they're not talking to a human. Plus, it answers immediately 24/7 vs. voicemail.

**Q: How long does setup take?**
A: 48 hours. We handle everything—you just approve the script.

**Q: What if it books the wrong appointment?**
A: It only books within your parameters (services, times, providers). You can review and adjust anytime.

**Q: Is this expensive?**
A: Most clinics see ROI in 2-3 bookings. Compare that to losing 20+ leads/month to voicemail.

Have other questions? Just reply—I read every email.

Rhigden
```

**Email 4: Direct Offer (Day 14)**
```
Subject: Ready to stop losing leads?

Hi [Name],

You've seen what Mercer can do.

Here's what I propose:

Let me set up a 7-day free trial for [Clinic Name].

You'll see exactly how many leads you're currently missing (I guarantee it's more than you think).

If it doesn't pay for itself in the first month, you don't pay.

Simple as that.

Want to start the trial? Just reply "YES" and I'll send the setup link.

Rhigden
```

**Email 5: Final Call (Day 21)**
```
Subject: Last follow-up on Mercer

Hi [Name],

This is my last email about Mercer.

If now's not the right time, I totally understand.

I'll keep you on my newsletter list where I share Med Spa marketing tips weekly.

If things change and you want to capture more leads from your ads, just reply anytime.

Best,
Rhigden
```

**Calling Script:**
```
"Hi [Name], this is Rhigden. I'm calling because I noticed [Clinic Name] is running ads on Instagram, and I wanted to ask: how are you handling calls that come in after hours or when your front desk is busy?

[Listen]

That makes sense. I actually built a tool specifically for Med Spas that acts as a 24/7 AI receptionist - it answers calls, qualifies leads, and books consultations automatically. 

A few clinics in Toronto are using it to capture leads they'd otherwise miss from their ads.

Would you be open to a quick 5-minute demo this week to see if it makes sense for [Clinic Name]?
```

## Finding Problems Worth Solving

### Framework: The "Vibe Coder" Problem Discovery

**1. Your Own Pain Points**
- What frustrates you as a creator?
- What tools/workflows are missing?
- What took you too long to figure out?

**2. Audience Observation**
- What questions do people ask in comments?
- What do creators complain about?
- What are the common mistakes you see?

**3. Data Analysis**
- Use SparkToro to find what your audience reads
- Analyze top-performing content in your niche
- Look for gaps (high interest, low competition)

**4. The "Mercer" Method**
- You're already solving a problem (Med Spa lead capture)
- Document this journey publicly
- Other problems will emerge from the process

### Q1 Problem Exploration

**Month 1:** Focus on documenting your own journey
- Building Mercer as a non-technical founder
- Learning data analytics for content
- Understanding marketing psychology

**Month 2:** Identify patterns from audience feedback
- What content gets the most engagement?
- What questions do people ask?
- What problems emerge from your DMs?

**Month 3:** Double down on highest-interest problems
- Create products around validated problems
- Test monetization
- Build systems for scale

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges

**1. "I don't know what to post about"**
- Solution: Use the content pillar system
- Keep a running list of ideas in Notion
- Repurpose everything

**2. "I'm not getting engagement"**
- Solution: Comment 10x more than you post
- Engage authentically with bigger accounts
- Be patient - first 100 followers are hardest

**3. "I'm running out of time"**
- Solution: Batch create content
- Use templates
- Focus on one platform first (Twitter)

**4. "Mercer isn't getting traction"**
- Solution: Document the struggle publicly
- Pivot messaging based on feedback
- Use personal brand to drive awareness

3. **Unique intersection** - Data + creativity + psychology is rare
4. **Building in public** - Mercer gives you endless content
5. **International student story** - Relatable, unique angle

**Remember:**
