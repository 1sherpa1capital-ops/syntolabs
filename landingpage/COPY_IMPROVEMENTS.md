# Copy Improvements for Synto Labs Landing Page

## Executive Summary

**Current Grade:** B (see original audit)
**Target Grade:** A
**Focus Areas:** Clarity, punchiness, grammatical fixes, sharper value prop

## Critical Fixes

### 1. Typos & Grammar
| Location | Current | Fixed |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Hero | "Every day you wait, you get more **replaceable**" | "Every day you wait, you fall further behind." |
| Pricing | "No **retainers**" | "No hidden fees" |
| Hero subhead | "We build AI systems for mid-market companies." | "We build AI systems that make companies unstoppable." |

### 2. Voice & Tone Consistency

**Current Issue:** Inconsistent voice—sometimes formal ("Development Services"), sometimes casual ("FIX MY OPERATIONS")

**Solution:** Consistent "confident direct" tone—professional but punchy

### 3. Section-by-Section Improvements

#### Hero Section
**Current copy issues:**
- "replaceable" is grammatically wrong and weak
- "mid-market companies" is generic
- Missing urgency hook

**Improved copy:**
```
<h1>AI isn't coming. It's here.</h1>
<p>Your competitors are already automating. Every day you wait, they get further ahead.</p>
<p>We build AI systems that make mid-market companies unstoppable.</p>
<p>25+ clients. 2.5x avg ROI. $2M+ saved.</p>
```

#### How It Works Section
**Current copy issues:**
- "You have a business. It runs on manual work." - too blunt
- Wordy explanations
- Unclear value prop

**Improved copy:**
```
<span>01 / HOW IT WORKS</span>
<h2>Two ways to win.</h2>

<div>
  <span>01</span>
  <h3>Operations Overhaul</h3>
  <p>
    Your business is bleeding time and money on manual workflows.
    We find the leaks, build AI systems that plug them, and stay on as your team.
    Other agencies hand off code and disappear.
    We embed, build what's next, and transform from the inside.
  </p>
  <a href="#apply">FIX MY OPERATIONS</a>
</div>

<div>
  <span>02</span>
  <h3>Platform Partnerships</h3>
  <p>
    You have the expertise. You need the builder.
    You bring the clients, domain knowledge, relationships.
    We bring a full AI-native dev team, product architecture, and go-to-market.
    Same risk. Same upside. No contractors. No handoffs.
  </p>
  <a href="#apply">PARTNER WITH US</a>
</div>
```

#### Why Automate Section
**Current copy issues:**
- "Businesses running on spreadsheets" - specific but limiting
- Could be more compelling

**Improved copy:**
```
<span>02 / WHY AUTOMATE?</span>
<h2>Automate now.<br />Or watch competitors do it.</h2>

<p>
  AI adoption isn't optional anymore. It's the difference between growing and getting left behind.
  Most companies know they need AI. They don't know where to start.
  We find your bottlenecks, build systems that eliminate them, and make sure they actually work.
</p>
```

#### Results Section
**Current:** Generally good, specific metrics
**Minor tweak:** Make testimonials pop more

```
<div>
  <span>-80% COST</span>
  <h3>Lead Gen Automation</h3>
  <p>SaaS Company • 10 employees</p>
  <p>"What used to take my sales team 4 hours every morning now runs while we sleep. The lead enrichment alone paid for the build in 3 weeks."</p>
  <p>— VP Sales, B2B SaaS</p>
</div>

<div>
  <span>-90% TIME</span>
  <h3>Client Onboarding</h3>
  <p>Consulting Firm • 15 employees</p>
  <p>"Client onboarding went from a 2-day manual scramble to a button press. We onboarded 12 new clients last month with zero extra work."</p>
  <p>— Operations Director</p>
</div>
```

#### Why Us Section
**Current:** Already strong
**Keep as-is**

#### Pricing Section
**Current copy issues:**
- "retainers" typo
- Descriptions could be clearer

**Improved copy:**

<h2>Questions?<br />We have answers.</h2>

  <h3>What kind of businesses do you work with?</h3>
  <p>SaaS, e-commerce, professional services, real estate, agencies, fintech. If you have repetitive workflows, we can automate them.</p>
