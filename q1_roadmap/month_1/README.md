## Week 3-4: Build Momentum

### Content Strategy (Psychology-Backed)

**Apply These Mental Models:**

1. **Zeigarnik Effect (Open Loops)**
   - Start threads with incomplete thoughts
   - End tweets with questions
   - Use cliffhangers: "Part 2 tomorrow"

2. **Mimetic Desire**
   - Show what successful creators are doing
   - Quote influential people (Theo, Dan Koe, Hormozi)

3. **Loss Aversion**
   - Frame content around what they'll lose: "The mistake costing you 1000 followers"

4. **Reciprocity**
   - Give massive value before asking
   - Free templates, frameworks, tools
