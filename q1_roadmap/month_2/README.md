### Collaboration Outreach

**Weekly Target:** DM 10 creators for potential collaborations

**Outreach Template:**
```
Hey [Name], love your content on [specific topic]. 

I'm building [Mercer/brand] and documenting the journey. 

Would you be open to a quick 15-min chat about [specific topic]? 

No pitch - just genuine curiosity about your approach to [specific thing].

Best,
Rhigden
```

### Cold Email/Calling Strategy

**Target:** Service businesses running paid ads

**Weekly Targets:**
- Cold emails sent: 20
- Cold calls made: 10
- Conversations started: 5
- Demos booked: 1-2

### Email Sequence

**Email 1 - Value First:**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Business Name]'s booking process

Hi [Name],

I came across [Business Name] while researching top [industry] in Toronto. 

Quick question: Are you currently running Meta/Instagram ads?

I ask because I built a tool that helps [industry] capture more leads from their ads by ensuring every call gets answered 24/7.

I noticed [specific observation about their current setup].

Happy to share a quick 2-minute video showing how this works for businesses like yours.

Best,
Rhigden
```

**Email 2 - Follow-up (3 days later):**
```
Subject: Re: Quick question about [Business Name]'s booking process

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note from a few days ago about capturing more leads from your ads.

I recorded a quick 90-second demo specifically for [Business Name] showing how an AI receptionist could handle after-hours inquiries.

[Link to Loom video]

Worth a 2-minute look?

```

**Email 3 - Breakup (7 days later):**
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume now's not the right time.

If you're ever interested in capturing more leads from your ads (especially those after-hours inquiries), feel free to reach out.

I also write a weekly newsletter on marketing psychology - happy to add you if interested.

Best,
Rhigden
```

### Calling Script

```
"Hi [Name], this is Rhigden. I'm calling because I noticed [Business Name] is running ads on Instagram, and I wanted to ask: how are you handling calls that come in after hours or when your front desk is busy?

[Listen]

That makes sense. I actually built a tool specifically for [industry] that acts as a 24/7 AI receptionist - it answers calls, qualifies leads, and books appointments automatically. 

A few businesses in Toronto are using it to capture leads they'd otherwise miss from their ads.

Would you be open to a quick 5-minute demo this week to see if it makes sense for [Business Name]?

## Lead Nurture Sequence (For Engaged Prospects)

**Goal:** Build relationship over 21 days

### Email 1: Value Delivery (Day 1)
```
Subject: The 3-minute lead audit

Hi [Name],

Thanks for your interest in Mercer.

I put together a quick audit you can run on your business in 3 minutes:

1. Call your business after hours. Do you get voicemail?
2. Check your Meta ad leads from last week. How many called vs. filled out forms?
3. Ask your front desk: "How many calls did you miss yesterday?"

Most businesses I talk to are shocked by #3.

If you want, I can run a more detailed audit for [Business Name]—just reply and I'll send over the results.

```

### Email 2: Social Proof (Day 4)
```
Subject: How [Similar Business] recovered $15K in lost bookings

Hi [Name],

Quick story:

[Similar Business] in [City] was spending $4K/month on Meta ads but missing 40% of calls.

Most came in after 6pm when their front desk was gone.

They implemented an AI receptionist in 48 hours.

Result: Captured 23 additional consultations in month 1 = $15K+ in recovered revenue.

Want to see if the same math works for [Business Name]?

I can show you the exact setup—just reply "demo" and I'll send a 2-minute video.

Rhigden
```

### Email 3: Objection Handler (Day 8)
```
Subject: "Will this sound robotic?" (and 3 other questions)

Hi [Name],

I get these questions a lot:

**Q: Will this sound robotic to my customers?**
A: Modern AI sounds natural—most callers don't realize they're not talking to a human. Plus, it answers immediately 24/7 vs. voicemail.

**Q: How long does setup take?**
A: 48 hours. We handle everything—you just approve the script.

**Q: What if it books the wrong appointment?**
A: It only books within your parameters. You can review and adjust anytime.

**Q: Is this expensive?**
A: Most businesses see ROI in 2-3 bookings. Compare that to losing 20+ leads/month to voicemail.

Have other questions? Just reply—I read every email.
