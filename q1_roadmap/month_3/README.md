```
Subject: Ready to stop losing leads?

Hi [Name],

You've seen what Mercer can do.

Here's what I propose:

Let me set up a 7-day free trial for [Business Name].

You'll see exactly how many leads you're currently missing (I guarantee it's more than you think).

If it doesn't pay for itself in the first month, you don't pay.

Simple as that.

Want to start the trial? Just reply "YES" and I'll send the setup link.

## Risk Mitigation (Month 3)

### Potential Challenges

**1. "I'm not getting engagement"**
- Solution: Comment 10x more than you post
- Engage authentically with bigger accounts
- Be patient - first 1000 followers are hardest

**2. "Mercer isn't getting traction"**
- Solution: Document the struggle publicly
- Pivot messaging based on feedback
- Use personal brand to drive awareness

**3. "Digital product isn't selling"**
- Solution: Pre-sell before building
- Offer money-back guarantee
- Get testimonials from beta users

**4. "I'm burning out"**
- Solution: Take weekends off
- Batch content in advance
- Focus on one platform if needed

## Final Notes

### Your Advantages
1. **Non-technical perspective** - Fresh eyes on technical topics
2. **Full-time availability** - Most creators have day jobs
3. **Unique intersection** - Data + creativity + psychology is rare
4. **Building in public** - Mercer gives you endless content
5. **International student story** - Relatable, unique angle

### Remember
- Consistency beats perfection
- Document, don't create
- Engage before you broadcast
- Your first 1000 followers are the hardest - then it compounds
- Use your cold outreach skills to fuel content

### Q1 is about building the machine. Q2 is about optimizing it. Q3 is about scaling it.

You've got this. Finish strong.
