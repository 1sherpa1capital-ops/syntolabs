# Brand Voice Review

## Overall Assessment
**Pass/Fail:** Pass with minor edits
**Score:** 9.2/10

Excellent work. The copy consistently captures "The Expert Engineer" voice with direct, confident, action-oriented messaging. Minor tweaks needed to tighten language and eliminate passive constructions.

---

## Hero Section
**Voice Score:** 9.5/10

- ✅ **Direct:** "Your best people are drowning in busywork" — Leads with the problem, zero fluff
- ✅ **Confident:** "No templates. No hallucinations." — Absolute statements, no hedging
- ✅ **Action:** "We deploy agent swarms" — Active verb, not "We provide" or "Our solution offers"
- ✅ **Human:** "the work you hate" — Emotional, relatable language (not "workflow inefficiencies")
- ✅ **Expert Engineer:** Opens with empathy for the problem, then delivers the solution with precision

**Issues:** None significant.

**Recommendation:** Already approved. Variation A is the strongest choice.

---

## Features Section
**Voice Score:** 9/10

- ✅ **Direct:** "Most AI guesses and hopes. Our agents verify every output." — Clear contrast, no sugar-coating
- ✅ **Confident:** "If It Hallucinates, You Don't Pay" — Bold guarantee, owns the outcome
- ✅ **Action:** "We connect to your existing tools" — Active voice
- ✅ **Human:** "No rip-and-replace. No migration headaches." — Speaks to real pain points engineers feel
- ✅ **Expert Engineer:** "MFR guardrails that enforce your business logic" — Technical precision without jargon overload

**Issues:**
- Minor: "delivered" in Feature 3 could be stronger (use "shipped" or "built")

**Recommendation:** Change "30-Day Support Included" to "30-Day Support. We Fix What Breaks." (matches "Radical ownership" tone)

---

## CTAs & Navigation
**Voice Score:** 10/10

- ✅ **Direct:** "Book the Build" — Two words, zero ambiguity
- ✅ **Confident:** "Book the Build — 48h" — Scarcity/authority trigger without desperation
- ✅ **Action:** "See How It Works" — "See" implies demonstration, not reading docs
- ✅ **Human:** "Build in Public" — Founder-led transparency signal
- ✅ **Expert Engineer:** "Results" instead of "Case Studies" — Engineers care about outcomes, not stories

**Issues:** None.

**Kill List Check:** 
- ✅ No "Contact Us" (too passive)
- ✅ No "Get Started" (too vague)
- ✅ No "Learn More" (implies work)

**Recommendation:** Approved as-is.

---

## Meta Tags
**Voice Score:** 8.5/10

- ✅ **Direct:** "Custom AI Automation in 48 Hours" — Specific, time-bound
- ✅ **Confident:** "If it hallucinates, you don't pay" — Guarantee front-loaded
- ✅ **Action:** "We automate the work you hate" — Active verb, emotional hook
- ⚠️ **Human:** Slightly less human due to SEO constraints, but acceptable
- ✅ **Expert Engineer:** "Working prototype guaranteed" — Results-focused

**Issues:**
1. Variation B title uses "Save 15+ Hours/Week" — "Save" is okay but "Get" or "Reclaim" is stronger
2. Variation C title "AI Agents That Don't Hallucinate" — slightly feature-focused instead of outcome-focused

**Recommendation:** 
- Stick with **Variation A** (Speed-Focused)
- Optional: Test "We Build AI Agents in 48 Hours" — uses "Build" from approved word list

---

## Critical Issues (Blockers)
None. All copy meets brand voice standards.

---

## Minor Issues (Suggestions)

1. **Hero Subheadline:** Consider testing "We deploy agent swarms that handle the work you hate." 
   - "Handle" is more active/owned than "automate" in some contexts
   - Current version is approved; this is an A/B test option

2. **Feature 3 Body:** "No templates. No cookie-cutter workflows."
   - Remove "workflows" — just "No templates. No cookie-cutter." is punchier

3. **Meta Description:** "Custom AI agents delivered in 48 hours"
   - Change "delivered" to "built" or "shipped" (aligns with brand vocabulary)

---

## Final Verdict

**PASS WITH MINOR EDITS**

The copy is 95% brand-compliant. Make these specific changes:

1. **features-copy.md line 18:** Change "No cookie-cutter workflows" → "No cookie-cutter."
2. **features-copy.md line 19:** Change "30-Day Support Included" → "30-Day Support. We Fix What Breaks."
3. **meta-copy.md line 5 (and line 59):** Change "delivered in 48 hours" → "built in 48 hours" (or "shipped")

These are polish-level edits. The core voice, tone, and messaging framework are spot-on.
