## Recommendation

**Variation A** best fits the brand for these reasons:

1. **Opens with the Hook** — "Your best people are drowning in busywork" is the exact problem statement from the Brand Guidelines messaging framework. It resonates immediately with B2B buyers who feel this pain daily.

2. **Expert Engineer Voice** — Direct, no BS, leads with empathy for the problem before offering the solution. This matches the "Direct + Human" voice traits.

3. **Action-Oriented Promise** — "We deploy" is active and confident. The bolded promises (48 hours, 15+ hours) follow the formatting rules and create visual hierarchy.

4. **Addresses the Core Gap** — The gap analysis identified that the current headline "says NOTHING about the problem or time savings." Variation A fixes both issues in the first sentence.

**Runner-up:** Variation C is strong for prospects further down the funnel who already understand AI risks. The guarantee headline is unique and memorable, but may confuse top-of-funnel visitors who haven't experienced AI hallucination pain yet.
