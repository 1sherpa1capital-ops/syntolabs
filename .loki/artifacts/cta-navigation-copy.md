## Recommendation
**Best primary CTA:** "Book the Build — 48h"

**Why:**
- Uses "Book" (action verb per guidelines)
- Uses "Build" (preferred word from kill list alternatives)
- Includes the 48-hour scarcity/authority trigger
- 5 words, punchy and direct
- Matches "The Expert Engineer" voice perfectly
- Replaces the weak "Deploy Protocol" with something that signals "we do the work"

**Secondary CTA:** "See How It Works" works better than "Technical Documentation" because:
- "See" is an action verb (not "learn" or "explore")
- Implies demonstration, not reading
- Still provides education without suggesting DIY

**Navigation reasoning:**
- "How It Works" = outcome-focused (they want to know the process)
- "Results" = outcome-focused (they want proof)
- "Book Build" = action-oriented (removes friction, no "Contact" or "Get Started" vagueness)

**Footer reasoning:**
- Conversion-focused links at the top
- "Build in Public" reinforces the founder-led transparency differentiator
- Keeps Privacy for compliance
- Removes GitHub (suggests product, not service)
